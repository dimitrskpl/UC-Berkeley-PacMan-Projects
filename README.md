# UC-Berkeley-PacMan-Projects

Solutions to The Pac-Man Projects from UC Berkeley CS188 | Intro to AI, which can be found on https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp21/projects/

* **Search:**
Implementation of depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world. **Autograder score: 26/25**.

* **Multiagent:**
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Implementation of multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designment of evaluation functions. **Autograder score: 25/25**.
